I've pretty much made this file, and now I can't figure out how to access it
As in, I do new File("nounlist.txt") but it can't find it.
I've tried every directory in the project file, but the program still can't find it,
Therefore, you can find it in io.github.vkb24312.confirmer.wordlist

Feel free to integrate the noun list into the code
